- Contact
		- Web form
			- email
			- first name
			- last name
			- subject
			- content (text area)
			- Submit button
				- This needs a submit handler, but you just need to display something like an alert, it doesn't have to actually send an email off.
		- Contact information
			- Does not need to actually contain your real info. Fake info is perfect.
